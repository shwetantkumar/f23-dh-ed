- COME, madam, come, all rest my powers defy ; 
- Until I labour, I in labour lie. 
- The foe ofttimes, having the foe in sight, 
- Is tired with standing, though he never fight. 
- Off with that girdle, like heaven's zone glittering, 
- But a far fairer world encompassing. 
- Unpin that spangled breast-plate, which you wear, 
- That th' eyes of busy fools may be stopp'd there. 
- Unlace yourself, for that harmonious chime 
- Tells me from you that now it is bed-time. 
- Off with that happy busk, which I envy, 
- That still can be, and still can stand so nigh. 
- Your gown going off such beauteous state reveals, 
- As when from flowery meads th' hill's shadow steals.
- Off with your wiry coronet, and show 
- The hairy diadems which on you do grow. 
- Off with your hose and shoes ; then softly tread 
- In this love's hallow'd temple, this soft bed. 
- In such white robes heaven's angels used to be 
- Revealed to men ; thou, angel, bring'st with thee 
- A heaven-like Mahomet's paradise ; and though 
- Ill spirits walk in white, we easily know 
- By this these angels from an evil sprite ; 
- Those set our hairs, but these our flesh upright. 
- {:.indent-3}Licence my roving hands, and let them go 
- Before, behind, between, above, below. 
- O, my America, my Newfoundland, 
- My kingdom, safest when with one man mann'd, 
- My mine of precious stones, my empery ; 
- How am I blest in thus discovering thee ! 
- To enter in these bonds, is to be free ; 
- Then, where my hand is set, my soul shall be. 
- {:.indent-3}Full nakedness !  All joys are due to thee ; 
- As souls unbodied, bodies unclothed must be 
- To taste whole joys.   Gems which you women use 
- Are like Atlanta's ball cast in men's views ; 
- That, when a fool's eye lighteth on a gem, 
- His earthly soul might court that, not them. 
- Like pictures, or like books' gay coverings made 
- For laymen, are all women thus array'd. 
- Themselves are only mystic books, which we 
- —Whom their imputed grace will dignify—
- Must see reveal'd.   Then, since that I may know, 
- As liberally as to thy midwife show 
- Thyself ; cast all, yea, this white linen hence ; 
- There is no penance due to innocence : 
- To teach thee, I am naked first ; why then, 
- What needst thou have more covering than a man?
